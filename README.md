<h3 align="center">Design and implement a Railway Reservation System in C++ that allows users to input train
details, display all train records, and search for a train by its number. The system should utilize
OOP principles including classes and objects, static members, constructors, destructors, arrays of
objects, getters & setters, which means overall encapsulation.</h3>
